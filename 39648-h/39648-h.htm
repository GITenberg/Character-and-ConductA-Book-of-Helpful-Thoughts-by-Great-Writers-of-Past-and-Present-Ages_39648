<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This collection of noble thoughts expressed by men
and women of past and present ages who have
endeavoured to leave the world a little better than
they found it, is similar in arrangement and purpose
to my former volume "Being and Doing"; and has
been compiled at the request of several readers who
have found that book helpful.</p>

<p>It is obvious that without the kindly co-operation
of many authors and publishers such books could
not exist, and I tender sincere and hearty thanks to
those who have made the work possible. All have
treated me with unfailing courtesy and generosity.</p>

<p>Where I have occasionally used short quotations
without permission I ask forgiveness.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to name separately each
one to whom I am a grateful debtor, so special
mention must only be made of the more heavily
taxed, and of those who have asked for a formal
acknowledgment, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Literary Executors of the late Mr. Ruskin,
<i>per</i> Mr. George Allen, for extracts from Mr. Ruskin's
works.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Arnold for those from <i>Red Pottage</i>,
by Mary Cholmondeley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>Canon Barnett for those from <i>The Service of God</i>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Deighton Bell &amp; Co. for those from <i>Pastor
Pastorum</i>, by the Rev. Henry Latham.</p>

<p>Mr. James Drummond for those from the writings
of Professor Henry Drummond.</p>

<p>Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co. for
those from Sir Edwin Arnold's <i>Light of Asia</i>.</p>

<p>Miss May Kendall for those from <i>Turkish Bonds</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Messrs. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. for those from
the works of Bishop Paget, and from Canon MacColl's
<i>Here and Hereafter</i>.</p>

<p>Professor MacCunn for those from <i>The Making of
Character</i>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co. for those from the works
of Bishop Westcott, Mrs. Bernard Bosanquet;
Tennyson's Poems; from the present Lord Tennyson's
Life of his father; from the <i>Mettle of the
Pasture</i>, by James Lane Allen; and from Mrs.
Humphry Ward's translation of <i>Amiel's Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Methuen &amp; Co. for one from the <i>Life of
R. L. Stevenson</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd Osbourne for those from R. L. Stevenson's
works.</p>

<p>Messrs. Wells, Gardner, Darton &amp; Co. for those
from Bishop Winnington Ingram's <i>Under the Dome</i>
and <i>Friends of the Master</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. John Watson for those from his writings.</p>

<p>Permission was kindly given me before by Messrs.
Macmillan to quote from the works of the late
Archbishop Temple and of Matthew Arnold. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Messrs. Smith, Elder &amp; Co. for quotations from
Robert Browning. By Mr. C. Lewes for quotations
from George Eliot; and from Lord Avebury and the
Rev. Stopford Brooke for those from their works.</p>

<p>In my experience the reading of extracts often
leads to the reading of the books from which they
were taken, and I hope and believe many of these
gleanings will serve as introductions.</p>

<p>JANUARY 1</p>

<p>"Here you stand at the parting of the ways; some
road you are to take; and as you stand here, consider
and know how it is that you intend to live. Carry no
bad habits, no corrupting associations, no enmities and
strifes into this New Year. Leave these behind, and let
the Dead Past bury its Dead; leave them behind, and
thank God that you are able to leave them."</p>

No backward glances toward the past,<br />

Yet do thou act as one new-born;<br />
What each day needs, that shalt thou ask,<br />
Each day will set its proper task."</p>

<p>JANUARY 2</p>

<p>"You did not come into this world by chance, you
were not born by accident. You all came charged
with a mission to use your best efforts to extend the
frontier of your Master's Kingdom by purifying your
own hearts and leavening for good the hearts of all
who come within the sphere of your influence. Your
business here is not to enjoy yourselves in those
fleeting pleasures which perish in the using; not to
sip as many dainties as you can from the moments
as they fly; not to gather as many flowers as you
can pluck from the garden of this perishing earth;
not even to rest in the enjoyment of those nobler
delights which come from the exercise of the intellect
in the investigation of the works of God and man;
but rather to do your best to fit yourselves and others
for the new heavens and new earth, which God has
prepared for those who love Him."</p>

<p>JANUARY 3</p>

<p>"A man's greatness lies not in wealth and station, as
the vulgar believe, nor yet in his intellectual capacity,
which is often associated with the meanest moral character,
the most abject servility to those in high places,
and arrogance to the poor and lowly; but a man's true
greatness lies in the consciousness of an honest purpose
in life, founded on a just estimate of himself and everything
else, on frequent self-examination, and a steady
obedience to the rule which he knows to be right,
without troubling himself about what others may think
or say, or whether they do or do not do that which he
thinks and says and does."</p>

<p>"Jesus and His Apostles teach that the supreme
success of life is not to escape pain but to lay hold
on righteousness, not to possess but to be holy, not
to get things from God but to be like God. They were
ever bidding Christians beware of ease, ever rousing
them to surrender and sacrifice."</p>

<p>"The end of life is not to deny self, nor to be true,

do God's will. It is not to get good nor be good, nor

that be working or waiting, or winning or losing, or
suffering or recovering, or living or dying."</p>

were dreaming of, what the modern Spiritualists tonight
are fumbling after. The power of the Holy
Ghost, by which every man who is in doubt may
know what is right, every man whose soul is sick
may be made spiritually whole, every weak man
may be made a strong man,&mdash;that is God's one sufficient
answer to the endless appeal of man's spiritual
life; that is God's one great response to the unconscious
need of spiritual guidance, which He hears
crying out of the deep heart of every man.&mdash;I hope
that I have made clear to you what I mean. I would
that we might understand ourselves, see what we
might be; nay, see what we are. While you are
living a worldly and a wicked life, letting all sacred
things go, caring for no duty, serving no God, there is
another self, your possibility, the thing that you might
be, the thing that God gave you a chance to be."</p>

<p>"People who love themselves aright, even as they
ought to love their neighbour, bear charitably,
though without flattery, with self as with another.
They know what needs correction at home as well
as elsewhere; they strive heartily and vigorously to
correct it, but they deal with self as they would deal
with some one else they wished to bring to God.
They set to work patiently, not exacting more than
is practicable under present circumstances from themselves
any more than from others, and not being
disheartened because perfection is not attainable in
a day."</p>

<p>"To be glad of life because it gives you the chance
to love and to work and to play and to look up at the
stars; to be satisfied with your possessions, but not
contented with yourself until you have made the best
of them; to despise nothing in the world except
falsehood and meanness, and to fear nothing except
cowardice; to be governed by your admirations rather
than by your disgusts; to covet nothing that is your
neighbour's except his kindness of heart and gentleness
of manners; to think seldom of your enemies,
often of your friends, and every day of Christ; and to
spend as much time as you can, with body and with
spirit, in God's out-of-doors&mdash;these are little guideposts

the goodness and beauty which excite his admiration.
His being grows up toward what thus evokes his
enthusiasm. And the habit of admiration is the outcome
of a moral discipline which represses peevish

in every situation and every person that life brings to
us. 'Be ye enlarged' implies 'learn to admire and

<p>JANUARY 22</p>

<p><i>Of Henry Drummond.</i>&mdash;"He seemed to be invariably
in good spirits, and invariably disengaged. He was
always ready for any and every office of friendship.
It should be said that though few men were more
criticised or misconceived, he himself never wrote an
unkind word about any one, never retaliated, never
bore malice, and could do full justice to the abilities
and character of his opponents. I have just heard
that he exerted himself privately to secure an important
appointment for one of his most trenchant
critics, and was successful.... The spectacle of
his long struggle with a mortal disease was something
more than impressive. Those who saw him in his
illness saw that, as the physical life flickered low, the
spiritual energy grew. Always gentle and considerate,
he became even more careful, more tender, more
thoughtful, more unselfish. He never in any way
complained. His doctors found it very difficult to get
him to talk of his illness. It was strange and painful,
but inspiring, to see his keenness, his mental elasticity,
his universal interest. Dr. Barbour says: 'I have never
seen pain or weariness, or the being obliged to do
nothing, more entirely overcome, treated, in fact, as if
they were not. The end came suddenly from failure
of the heart. Those with him received only a few
hours' warning of his critical condition.' It was not
like death. He lay on his couch in the drawing-room,
and passed away in his sleep, with the sun shining in,
and the birds singing at the open window. There was
no sadness nor farewell. It recalled what he himself
said of a friend's death&mdash;'putting by the well-worn
tools without a sigh, and expecting elsewhere better
work to do.'"</p>

<p>JANUARY 25</p>

<p>"Perfection is being, not doing&mdash;it is not to effect
an act, but to achieve a character. If the aim of life
were to do something, then, as in an earthly business,
except in doing this one thing the business would be
at a standstill. The student is not doing the one
thing of student-life when he has ceased to think or
read. The labourer leaves his work undone when the
spade is not in his hand, and he sits beneath the
hedge to rest. But in Christian life, every moment
and every act is an opportunity for doing the one
thing of <i>becoming</i> Christ-like. Every day is full of
a most expressive experience. Every temptation to
evil temper which can assail us to-day will be an
opportunity to decide the question whether we shall
gain the calmness and the rest of Christ, or whether
we shall be tossed by the restlessness and agitation of
the world. Nay, the very vicissitudes of the season,
day and night, heat and cold, affecting us variably,
and producing exhilaration or depression, are so contrived
as to conduce towards the being which we
become, and decide whether we shall be masters of
ourselves, or whether we shall be swept at the mercy
of accident and circumstance, miserably susceptible
of merely outward influences. Infinite as are the
varieties of life, so manifold are the paths to saintly
character; and he who has not found out how directly
or indirectly to make everything converge towards his
soul's sanctification, has as yet missed the meaning of
this life."</p>

<p>JANUARY 27</p>

<p>"If we wish to cultivate our higher nature we must
have solitude. It is vitally necessary at times that
we should be able to get away from every other being
on the face of the earth. What thoughtful person
does not love to be alone; to be surrounded with no
objects but the fields and the trees, the mountains
and the waters, to hear nothing but the rustling of
the foliage and the songs of the birds, and to feel
the fresh breeze of heaven playing upon his cheeks?
Moreover, when we are very much in contact with
human life, when we are mingling with it, we are
liable to become too conscious of its turbid side, or
drearily oppressed with its commonplace features.
To see human life, and weigh it in its many aspects,
we need at times to go away and be as it were on a
pinnacle, where we can take it all in with one sweeping
glance. Solitude can affect us somewhat as
religious worship does. It can take us out of the consciousness
of where we belong, away from the ordinary
selfish instincts by which we may be dominated.</p>

<p>"Too much solitude may be dangerous, just as too
much of the sense of mystery may be. Yet something
of it is essential to our advance in spiritual
life. A man must go away where he can feel the
mystery of his own being. Moreover, a certain degree
of solitude seems necessary to the full growth of the
mind, and it is in solitude that great principles are
first thought out, and the genius of eminent men
formed, for solitude is the nurse of enthusiasm, and
enthusiasm is the real parent of genius. Solitude,
moreover, is essential to any depth of meditation
or of character, and is the cradle of thoughts and
aspirations."</p>

kinds. There is the triviality which concerns itself
with 'nothing,' which gossips about 'him' and
'her,' and becomes serious over a form, a phrase,
a dress, a race or a show. There is the triviality to
which the working people are forced by the cares of
this life, who all day and every day have to think of
the bread which perisheth, while their souls starve
for lack of knowledge which endureth. The cares of
life as often choke the growth of the Word as the
deceitfulness of riches. There is also that most
insidious kind of triviality which tends to haunt the
more serious circles, wrapping itself in talk about
social schemes, Church progress, policies and philosophies,

<p>"Since unconscious life is not possible to the intellectual
adult, as it is to the child&mdash;since he cannot go
on living without a thought about the nature of his
own being, its end and aim&mdash;it is good for him to
cultivate a habit of repose, that he may think and feel
like a man putting away those childish things&mdash;the
carelessness, the thoughtless joy, 'the tear forgot
as soon as shed,' which, however beautiful, because
appropriate, in childhood, are not beautiful because
not appropriate in mature age.</p>

<p>"The art of being quiet is necessary to enable a man
to possess his own soul in peace and integrity&mdash;to
examine himself, to understand what gifts God has
endowed him with, and to consider how he may best
employ them in the business of the world. This is
its universal utility. It is unwholesome activity which
requires not repose and thoughtful quiet as its forerunner,
and every man should secure some portion of
each day for voluntary retirement and repose within
himself."</p>

needful is to throw off all one's load of cares, of
preoccupations, of pedantry, and to become again
young, simple, child-like, living happily and gratefully
in the present hour. We must know how to put occupation
aside, which does not mean that we must be
idle. In an inaction which is meditative and attentive
the wrinkles of the soul are smoothed away, and the
soul itself spreads, unfolds, and springs afresh, and,
like the trodden grass of the roadside or the bruised
leaf of a plant, repairs its injuries, becomes new,
spontaneous, true, and original. Reverie, like the rain

gathers round us materials for the future, and images

<p>FEBRUARY 2</p>

<p>"Perhaps one very simple, but alas too often neglected
rule, may be suggested to those who are indeed
desirous of realising through all the petty vicissitudes
and monotonous or trivial round of their daily life, the
Divine presence and power. 'Devotion early in the
day <i>before the day's worries begin.</i> It is the <i>only</i> way to
keep the spirit Godward through them all.' Devotion,
it is needless to add, is not 'saying prayers' in words
either of our own or any one else's&mdash;nor is it only or
chiefly 'making request.' It is pre-eminently <i>worship</i>,
the deliberate homage of the mind and heart&mdash;of the
whole being to God who is its source. And here
steadfastness of will, showing itself in determined
concentration of attention, is the indispensable condition
of success; for such concentration is by no means
always an easy matter to attain, even when the effort
is 'made early in the day before the day's worries
begin.' Sometimes there are sleepless 'worries'
which assert their presence with the first dawn of
consciousness; sometimes we are mentally or physically
lazy, inert or languid. Well, if we habitually give in to
such difficulties in a way of which we should be utterly
ashamed were any other object of mental effort in
question, we must not be surprised if the entirely
natural result ensues that we fail to 'realise' what we
have never honestly set ourselves to treat as real....
Amid the thronging duties, the ceaseless cares,
the toilsome or pleasurable round of daily life, we
must take and we must keep time to 'commune with
our own hearts and in our own chamber, and be still.'"</p>

that they have worked hard in their district, or their
school, or their class, and yet there is no result.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have worked too hard. There are a
multitude of Marthas in modern English life; but it
were good for such if, at times, they would follow the

<p>FEBRUARY 5</p>

<p>"It is very important to cultivate business-like habits.
An eminent friend of mine assured me not long ago
that when he thought over the many cases he had
known of men, even of good ability and high character,
who had been unsuccessful in life, by far the most
frequent cause of failure was that they were dilatory,
unpunctual, unable to work cordially with others,
obstinate in small things, and, in fact, what we call
unbusiness-like."</p>

for an alarm. The quickness of a true man of business
he imitateth, imitateth excellently well, but neither his
silence nor his method; and it is to be noted that he is
ever most vehement about matters of no significance.
He is always in such headlong haste to overtake the
next minute, that he loses half the minute in hand; and
yet is full of indignation and impatience at other people's
slowness, and wasteth more time in reiterating his love
of despatch than would suffice for doing a great deal of
business. He never giveth you his quiet attention with
a mind centred on what you are saying, but hears you
with a restless eye, and a perpetual shifting posture,
and is so eager to show his quickness that he interrupteth
you a dozen times, misunderstands you as
often, and ends by making you and himself lose twice
as much time as was necessary."</p>

<p>"One of the striking characteristics of successful
persons is their faculty of readily determining the
relative importance of different things. There are
many things which it is desirable to do, a few are essential,
and there is no more useful quality of the human
mind than that which enables its possessor at once to
distinguish which the few essential things are. Life
is so short and time so fleeting that much which one
would wish to do must fain be omitted. He is fortunate
who perceives at a glance what it will do, and what it
will not do, to omit. This invaluable faculty, if not
possessed in a remarkable degree naturally, is susceptible
of cultivation to a considerable extent. Let
any one adopt the practice of reflecting, every morning,
what must necessarily be done during the day, and then
begin by doing the most important things first, leaving
the others to take their chance of being done or left
undone. In this way attention first to the things of
first importance soon acquires the almost irresistible
force of habit, and becomes a rule of life. There is no
rule more indispensable to success."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><b>Concentration</b></p>


<p>FEBRUARY 7</p>

<p>"The marked differences of working power among
men are due chiefly to differences in the power of concentration.
A retentive and accurate memory is conditioned
upon close attention. If one gives entire attention
to what is passing before him, he is not likely to forget
it, or to confuse persons or incidents. The book which
one reads with eyes which are continually lifted from
the page may furnish entertainment for the moment,
but cannot enrich the reader, because it cannot become
part of his knowledge. Attention is the simplest form
of concentration, and its value illustrates the supreme
importance of that focussing of all the powers upon
the thing in hand which may be called the sustained
attention of the whole nature.</p>

<p>"Here, as everywhere in the field of man's life, there
enters that element of sacrifice without which no real
achievement is possible. To secure a great end, one
must be willing to pay a great price. The exact adjustment
of achievement to sacrifice makes us aware, at
every step, of the invisible spiritual order with which
all men are in every kind of endeavour. If the highest
skill could be secured without long and painful effort,
it would be wasted through ignorance of its value, or
misused through lack of education; but a man rarely
attains great skill without undergoing a discipline of
self-denial and work which gives him steadiness, restraint,
and a certain kind of character. The giving
up of pleasures which are wholesome, the turning aside
from fields which are inviting, the steady refusal of
invitations and claims which one would be glad to
accept or recognise, invest the power of concentration
with moral quality, and throw a searching light on the
nature of genuine success.</p>

<p>"To do one thing well, a man must be willing to
hold all other interests and activities subordinate; to
attain the largest freedom, a man must first bear the
cross of self-denial."</p>

<p>"To know how to be ready&mdash;a great thing&mdash;a precious
gift,&mdash;and one that implies calculation, grasp and decision.
To be always ready, a man must be able to cut
a knot, for everything cannot be untied; he must know
how to disengage what is essential from the detail in
which it is enwrapped, for everything cannot be equally
considered; in a word, he must be able to simplify his
duties, his business, and his life. To know how to be
ready, is to know how to start.</p>

<p>"It is astonishing how all of us are generally
cumbered up with the thousand and one hindrances
and duties which are not such, but which nevertheless
wind us about with their spider threads and fetter the
movement of our wings. It is the lack of order which
makes us slaves; the confusion of to-day discounts the
freedom of to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Confusion is the enemy of all comfort, and confusion
is born of procrastination. To know how to be ready
we must be able to finish. Nothing is done but what is
finished. The things which we leave dragging behind
us will start up again later on before us and harass our
path. Let each day take thought for what concerns it,
liquidate its own affairs and respect the day which is to
follow, and then we shall be always ready. To know

order. To know where one is going and what one
wishes&mdash;this is order; to keep one's word and one's
engagements&mdash;again order; to have everything ready
under one's hand, to be able to dispose of all one's
forces, and to have all one's means of whatever kind
under command&mdash;still order; to discipline one's habits,
one's efforts, one's wishes; to organise one's life, to
distribute one's time, to take the measure of one's
duties and make one's rights respected; to employ
one's capital and resources, one's talent and one's
chances profitably;&mdash;all this belongs to and is included
in the word <i>order</i>. Order means light and peace,
inward liberty and free command over oneself; order
is power. Æsthetic and moral beauty consist, the
first in a true conception of order, and the second in
submission to it, and in the realisation of it, by, in, and

to industry and physical endurance. Indeed, I am
much disposed to think that endurance is the most
valuable quality of all; for industry, as the desire to
work hard, does not come to much if a feeble frame is
unable to respond to the desire. No life is wasted
unless it ends in sloth, dishonesty, or cowardice. No
success is worthy of the name unless it is won by
honest industry and brave breasting of the waves of
fortune.'"</p>

<p>"Of all work producing results, nine-tenths must be
drudgery. There is no work, from the highest to the
lowest, which can be done well by any man who is
unwilling to make that sacrifice. Part of the very
nobility of the devotion of the true workman to his
work consists in the fact that a man is not daunted by
finding that drudgery must be done, and no man can
really succeed in any walk of life without a good deal

'You must not expect too much of him,' so it is said.
'You must remember that he is only a man after all.'
'Only a man!' That sounds to me as if one said,

you must not expect to go very far. It is only the
Atlantic Ocean.' Why, man's moral range and reach
is practically infinite, at least no man has yet begun to

<p>"No man who, being a Christian, desires the kingdom
of God, can justly neglect giving his energy to the
bettering of the social, physical, and educational condition
of the poor, the diseased, and the criminal
classes. But he is not a Christian, or he has not
realised the problem fully, if that is all he does. Social
improvement is a work portions of which any one can
do, in which all ought to share; but if we who follow
Christ desire to do the best work in that improvement,
and in the best way, we ought to strive&mdash;while we join
in the universal movement towards a juster society&mdash;to
give a spiritual life to that movement; to keep it at an
ideal level; to free it from mere materialism; to maintain
in it the monarchy of self-sacrifice; to fix its eyes
on invisible and unworldly truths; to supply it with
noble and spiritual faiths; to base all associations of
men on the ground of their spiritual union&mdash;all being
children of God, and brothers of one another, in the
love and faith by which Jesus lived; and to maintain
the dignity of this spiritual communion of men in faith
in their immortal union with God. This is the fight of
faith we, as fellow-workers with God, shall have to
wage; and this not only binds us up with the poor,
but with the rich, not only with the ignorant, but the
learned; for on these grounds all men are seen as
stripped of everything save of their humanity and
their divine kinship.... Improve, then, the material
condition and the knowledge of all who are struggling
for justice; it is part of your life which if you neglect,
you are out of touch with the new life; but kindle in
it, uphold and sanctify in it, the life which is divine,
the communion with man of God, without union with
whose character all effort for social improvement will
revert to new miseries and new despair."</p>

<p>"Idleness standing in the midst of unattempted
tasks is always proud. Work is always tending to
humility. Work touches the keys of endless activity,
opens the infinite, and stands awe-struck before the
immensity of what there is to do. Work brings a man
into the good realm of facts. Work takes the dreamy
youth who is growing proud in his closet over one or
two sprouting powers which he has discovered in himself,
and sets him out among the gigantic needs and
the vast processes of the world, and makes him feel
his littleness. Work opens the measureless fields of
knowledge and skill that reach far out of sight. I am
sure we all know the fine, calm, sober humbleness of
men who have really tried themselves against the
great tasks of life. It was great in Paul, and in
Luther, and in Cromwell. It is something that never
comes into the character, never shows in the face of a
man who has never worked."</p>

that we do it with all our might. Having done that,
there is no cause to fret ourselves or ask questions
which cannot be answered. We may rest with a quiet
conscience and a contented heart, for we have filled
our place and done what we could. The battle of life
extends over a vast area, and it is vain for us to
inquire about the other wings of the army; it is

have held the few feet of ground committed to our

so fighting and so dying in the place of duty we cannot
be condemned, we must be justified. Brilliant

are within our reach, and character is built up not out
of great intellectual gifts and splendid public achievements,

courtesy, and gratitude, resting upon faith in God and

<p>FEBRUARY 22</p>

<p>"There is a certain amount of work to be done in
this world. If any of us does not take his full share,
he imposes that which he does not take on the
shoulders of another; and the first cause of poverty,
of disease, of misery in all States, is the overwork
which is imposed on men and women by the idle and
indifferent members of the nation. This is to steal
from the human race; to steal from them joy, leisure,
health, comfort and peace, and to impose on them
sorrow and overwork, disease and homelessness, bitter
anger and fruitless tears. This is the curse which
the selfish dreamer leaves behind him. Many have
been the fierce oppressors and defrauders of the
human race, but the evil they have done is less than
that done by those who drop by drop and hour by
hour drain the blood of mankind by doing no work for
the overworked. This is the crime with which the
idle and indifferent will be confronted when the great
throne is set in our soul, and the books we have
written on men's lives are opened, and God shall lay
judgment to the line and righteousness to the plummet.
'Lord, what hast Thou to do with it?' we will say.
'I did not neglect Thee; I took my ease, it is true,
but I kept Thy law. I was never impious, never an
atheist. When was I not religious?' Then He will
answer: 'Inasmuch as ye never worked for the least
of these My brothers, ye never worked for Me!'"</p>

<p>"We shall not do much of that which is best worth doing in
the world if we only consecrate to it our gifts. We have
something else to consecrate for our work's sake, for our
friend's sake, for the sake of all for whom in any way we
are responsible. Beyond and above all that we may do, is
that which we may be. 'For their sakes I sanctify, I consecrate,
Myself.' So our Blessed Lord spoke in regard to
those whom He had drawn nearest to Himself&mdash;His friends;
those whose characters He would fashion for the greatest
task that ever yet was laid upon frail men. And even when
we have set apart all that was unique in the nature and
results of His Self-consecration, all that He alone could,
once for all, achieve; still, I think, the words disclose a
principle that concerns every one of us&mdash;the principle of all
that is highest and purest in the influence of one life upon
the lives it touches: 'For their sakes I consecrate Myself.'
There is the ultimate secret of power; the one sure way
of doing good in our generation. We cannot anticipate or
analyse the power of a pure and holy life; but there can be
no doubt about its reality, and there seems no limit to its
range. We can only know in part the laws and forces of
the spiritual world; and it may be that every soul that is
purified and given up to God and to His work releases or
awakens energies of which we have no suspicion&mdash;energies
viewless as the wind; but we can be sure of the result, and
we may have glimpses sometimes of the process&mdash;surely,
there is no power in the world so unerring or so irrepressible
as the power of personal holiness. All else at times goes
wrong, blunders, loses proportion, falls disastrously short
of its aim, grows stiff or one-sided, or out of date&mdash;'whether
there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there
be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it
shall vanish away;' but nothing mars or misleads the
influence that issues from a pure and humble and unselfish
character."</p>

<p>"Nothing is more characteristic of Jesus' method
than His indifference to the many&mdash;His devotion to
the single soul. His attitude to the public, and His
attitude to a private person were a contrast and a
contradiction. If His work was likely to cause a
sensation Jesus charged His disciples to let no man
know it: if the people got wind of Him, He fled to
solitary places: if they found Him, as soon as might
be He escaped. But He used to take young men
home with Him, who wished to ask questions: He
would spend all night with a perplexed scholar: He
gave an afternoon to a Samaritan woman. He denied
Himself to the multitude: He lay in wait for the
individual. This was not because He under-valued
a thousand, it was because He could not work on the
thousand scale: it was not because He over-valued the
individual, it was because His method was arranged
for the scale of one. Jesus never succeeded in public
save once, when He was crucified: He never failed in
private save once, with Pontius Pilate. His method
was not sensation: it was influence. He did not rely
on impulses: He believed in discipline. He never
numbered converts, because He knew what was in
man: He sifted them, as one winnoweth the wheat
from the chaff. Spiritual statistics are unknown in
the Gospels: they came in with St. Peter in the
pardonable intoxication of success: they have since
grown to be a mania. As the Church coarsens she
estimates salvation by quantity, how many souls are
saved: Jesus was concerned with quality, after what
fashion they were saved. His mission was to bring
Humanity to perfection."</p>

<p>"So long as there is work to do there will be interruptions&mdash;breaks
in its progress. The minister at
work on his sermon, the merchant at his desk, the
woman in her household duties&mdash;all must expect
these calls to turn aside from the work in hand. And
it is a part of one's character growth to bear these
timely or untimely interruptions without any break in
good temper or courtesy. A young student who was
privileged to call often upon Phillips Brooks in his study,
told the writer that he could never have learned from
the Bishop's manner or words, that the big-hearted,
busy man was ever too busy to receive him. To bear
interruptions thus serenely is an opportunity for self-control
not to be overlooked by any one who wants to
do God's work in the right spirit."</p>

<p>"He threw himself spontaneously, apparently without
effort and yet irresistibly, into the griefs and joys, the
needs and interests of others. He had the happy gift
of taking everybody to his heart. He was never inattentive.
As you talked to him you always felt he
was listening and really trying to understand your
case. In the light of sympathy you saw yourself
reflected in the mirror of his heart. Nor did he forget
you when you were gone from sight. His was not
the cheap sympathy of an outward manner, but the
true emotion of the inward self. To your surprise,
when you had left Bishop Fraser with a sense of shame
at having occupied, in your interview, so much of his
overcrowded time, you would find the next morning
a letter upon your table giving his fuller and more
mature opinion of your plans or course of action."...

<p>"That is not difficult. But to hallow God's character
in men and women who are not good, in sinful
humanity&mdash;that is not so easy. Yet, if we would be
true to this prayer of Christ, this too is part of our
duty. The evil are also the children of God. They
have not hallowed His character, but abandoned its
worship. Nevertheless they cannot get rid of it. That
divine thing lies hid, ineradicably, beneath their evil
doing and evil thought. The truth, justice, love,
piety, and goodness of God are in abeyance in the
wrong-doer, but they are not dead in him. They
cannot die; nothing can destroy them. And we,
whose desire it should be to save men, can, if we
have faith in the indestructible God in men, pierce to
this immortal good in the evil, appeal to it, and call it
forth to light, like Lazarus, from the tomb. This we
can do, if, like Jesus, we love men enough; if our faith
that the evil are still God's children be deep and firm
enough. In this we can keep closest to Christ, for it
was His daily way of life; and divinely beautiful it
was. He hallowed God's character in the criminal and
the harlot. He saw the good beneath the evil. At
His touch it leaped into life, and its life destroyed the
death in the sinner's soul. It seems as if He said
when He looked into the face of the wrong-doer,
'Father, hallowed be Thy character.' No lesson for
life can be wiser or deeper than this. It ought to
rule all our doings with the weak and guilty. It is at
the very centre of the prayer, 'Hallowed be Thy name.'"</p>

<p>MARCH 27</p>

<p>"The preservation of health is a <i>duty</i>. Few men seem
conscious that there is such a thing as physical
morality. Men's habitual words and acts imply the
idea that they are at liberty to treat their bodies as
they please. Disorders entailed by disobedience to
Nature's dictates they regard simply as grievances,
not as the effects of a conduct more or less flagitious.
Though the evil consequences inflicted on their dependants,
and on future generations, are often as great
as those caused by crime, yet they do not think themselves
in any degree criminal. It is true that in the
case of drunkenness the viciousness of this bodily
transgression is recognised, but none appear to infer
that if this bodily transgression is vicious, so, too,
is every bodily transgression. The fact is that all
breaches of the laws of health are <i>physical sins</i>."</p>

churches. Their weak voices spoke gospels. The

They were depended on while they seemed to be
most dependent. And when they died, when the faint

<p>MARCH 31&mdash;APRIL 1</p>

<p>"There is a temperament called <i>Hypochondriac</i>, to
which many persons, some of them the brightest, the
most interesting, the most gifted, are born heirs,&mdash;a
want of balance of the nervous powers, which tends
constantly to periods of high excitement and of consequent
depression,&mdash;an unfortunate inheritance for the
possessor, though accompanied often with the greatest
talents....</p>

<p>"People of this temperament are subject to fits of
gloom and despondency, of nervous irritability and
suffering, which darken the aspect of the whole world
to them, which present lying reports of their friends,
of themselves, of the circumstances of their life, and of
all with which they have to do.</p>

<p>"Now the highest philosophy for persons thus
afflicted is to understand themselves and their tendencies,
to know that these fits of gloom and depression
are just as much a form of disease as a fever or a
toothache,&mdash;to know that it is the peculiarity of the
disease to fill the mind with wretched illusions, to
make them seem miserable and unlovely to themselves,
to make their nearest friends seem unjust and unkind,
to make all events appear to be going wrong and
tending to destruction and ruin.</p>

<p>"The evils and burdens of such a temperament are
half removed when a man once knows that he has it,
and recognises it for a disease,&mdash;when he does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
trust himself to speak and act in those bitter hours as
if there were any truth in what he thinks and feels
and sees. He who has not attained to this wisdom
overwhelms his friends and his family with the waters
of bitterness; he stings with unjust accusations, and
makes his fireside dreadful with fancies which are
real to him, but false as the ravings of fever.</p>

<p>"A sensible person, thus diseased, who has found
out what ails him, will shut his mouth resolutely, not
to give utterance to the dark thoughts that infest his
soul.</p>

<p>"A lady of great brilliancy and wit, who was subject
to these periods, once said to me, 'My dear sir,
there are times when I know I am possessed of the
Devil, and then I never let myself speak.' And so
this wise woman carried her burden about with her
in a determined, cheerful reticence, leaving always the
impression of a cheery, kindly temper, when, if she
had spoken out a tithe of what she thought and felt
in her morbid hours, she would have driven all her
friends from her, and made others as miserable as she
was herself. She was a sunbeam, a life-giving presence
in every family, by the power of self-knowledge
and self-control."</p>

<p>APRIL 3</p>

<p>"Irritability is, more than most unlovely states, a
sin of the flesh. It is not, like envy, malice, spite,
revenge, a vice which we may suppose to belong
equally to an embodied or a disembodied spirit: in
fact, it comes nearer to being physical depravity than
anything I know of. There are some bodily states,
some conditions of the nerves, such that we could not
conceive of even an angelic spirit, confined in a body
thus disordered, as being able to do any more than
simply endure. It is a state of nervous torture; and
the attacks which the wretched victim makes on others
are as much a result of disease as the snapping and
biting of a patient convulsed with hydrophobia....
I think it is undeniable that the peace and happiness
of the home-circle are very generally much invaded by
the recurrence in its members of these states of bodily
irritability. Every person, if he thinks the matter
over, will see that his condition in life, the character
of his friends, his estimate of their virtues and failings,
his hopes and expectations, are all very much modified
by these things. Cannot we all remember going to
bed as very ill-used, persecuted individuals, all whose
friends were unreasonable, whose life was full of trials
and crosses, and waking up on a bright bird-singing
morning to find all these illusions gone with the fogs
of the night? Our friends are nice people, after all;
the little things that annoyed us look ridiculous by
bright sunshine; and we are fortunate individuals."</p>

<p>"The philosophy of life, then, as far as this matter is
concerned, must consist of two things: first, to keep
ourselves out of irritable bodily states; and, second,
to understand and control these states, when we cannot
ward them off. Of course, the first of these is the
most important; and yet, of all things, it seems to be
least looked into and understood. We find abundant
rules for the government of the tongue and temper;
it is a slough into which, John Bunyan hath it, cartloads
of wholesome instructions have been thrown; but
how to get and keep that healthy state of brain,
stomach, and nerves which takes away the temptation
to ill-temper and anger is a subject which moral and
religious teachers seem scarcely to touch upon....
We have a common saying, that this or that person is
soon used up. Now most nervous, irritable states of
temper are the mere physical result of a used-up condition.
The person has overspent his nervous energy,&mdash;like
a man who should eat up on Monday the whole
food which was to keep him for a week, and go
growling and faint through the other days; or the
quantity of nervous force which was wanted to carry
on the whole system in all its parts is seized on by
some one monopolising portion, and used up to the
loss and detriment of the rest."</p>

tells us, in the midst of our letters, and railway

<p>"And now, as ever, over against Accidie rises the
great grace of Fortitude; the grace that makes men
undertake hard things by their own will wisely and
reasonably. There is something in the very name of
Fortitude which speaks to the almost indelible love of
heroism in men's hearts; but perhaps the truest Fortitude
may often be a less heroic, a more tame and
business-like affair than we are apt to think. It may be
exercised chiefly in doing very little things, whose whole
value lies in this, that, if one did not hope in God, one
would not do them; in secretly dispelling moods which
one would like to show; in saying nothing about one's
lesser troubles and vexations; in seeing whether it may
not be best to bear a burden before one tries to see
whither one can shift it; in refusing for one's self
excuses which one would not refuse for others. These,
anyhow, are ways in which a man may every day be
strengthening himself in the discipline of Fortitude;
and then, if greater things are asked of him, he is
not very likely to draw back from them. And while
he waits the asking of these greater things, he may
be gaining from the love of God a hidden strength and
glory such as he himself would least of all suspect;
he may be growing in the patience and perseverance
of the saints. For most of us the chief temptation to
lose heart, the chief demand upon our strength, comes
in the monotony of our failures, and in the tedious
persistence of prosaic difficulties; it is the distance,
not the pace, that tries us. To go on choosing what
has but a look of being the more excellent way, pushing
on towards a faintly glimmering light, and never
doubting the supreme worth of goodness even in its
least brilliant fragments,&mdash;this is the normal task of
many lives; in this men show what they are like. And
for this we need a quiet and sober Fortitude, somewhat
like that which Botticelli painted, and Mr. Ruskin

<p>APRIL 11</p>

<p>"What is temper? Its primary meaning, the proportion
and mode in which qualities are mingled, is
much neglected in popular speech, yet even here the
word often carries a reference to an habitual state or
general tendency of the organism in distinction from
what are held to be specific virtues and vices. As
people confess to bad memory without expecting to
sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared
to have a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor
of every high quality. When he errs or in any way
commits himself, his temper is accused, not his character,
and it is understood that but for a brutal
bearish mood he is kindness itself. If he kicks small
animals, swears violently at a servant who mistakes
orders, or is grossly rude to his wife, it is remarked
apologetically that these things mean nothing&mdash;they
are all temper.</p>

<p>"Certainly there is a limit to this form of apology;
and the forgery of a bill, or the ordering of goods
without any prospect of paying for them, has never
been set down to an unfortunate habit of sulkiness
or of irascibility. But on the whole there is a peculiar
exercise of indulgence towards the manifestations of
bad temper which tends to encourage them, so that
we are in danger of having among us a number of
virtuous persons who conduct themselves detestably,
just as we have hysterical patients who, with sound
organs, are apparently labouring under many sorts of
organic disease. Let it be admitted, however, that
a man may be a 'good fellow' and yet have a bad
temper, so bad that we recognise his merits with
reluctance, and are inclined to resent his occasionally
amiable behaviour as an unfair demand on our
admiration."</p>

sulkiness, touchiness, doggedness,&mdash;these
are the staple ingredients of Ill-Temper. And
yet men laugh over it. 'Only temper,' they call it:
a little hot-headedness, a momentary ruffling of the
surface, a mere passing cloud. But the passing cloud
is composed of drops, and the drops here betoken an
ocean, foul and rancorous, seething somewhere within
the life&mdash;an ocean made up of jealousy, anger, pride,
uncharity, cruelty, self-righteousness, sulkiness, touchiness,
doggedness, lashed into a raging storm.</p>

<p>"This is why temper is significant. It is not in what
it is that its significance lies, but in what it reveals.
But for this it were not worth notice. It is the intermittent
fever which tells of un-intermittent disease; the
occasional bubble escaping to the surface, betraying
the rottenness underneath; a hastily prepared specimen
of the hidden products of the soul, dropped involuntarily

I doubt the possibility that a high order of character
can co-exist with a temper like Touchwood's. For it
is of the nature of such temper to interrupt the formation
of healthy mental habits, which depend on a
growing harmony between perception, conviction, and
impulse. There may be good feelings, good deeds&mdash;for
a human nature may pack endless varieties and
blessed inconsistencies in its windings&mdash;but it is
essential to what is worthy to be called high character,
that it may be safely calculated on, and that its
qualities shall have taken the form of principles or
laws habitually, if not perfectly, obeyed. If a man
frequently passes unjust judgments, takes up false
attitudes, intermits his acts of kindness with rude
behaviour or cruel words, and falls into the consequent
vulgar error of supposing that he can make amends
by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such
courses any the less ugly because they are ascribed
to 'temper.' Especially I object to the assumption
that his having a fundamentally good disposition is
either an apology or a compensation for his bad
behaviour."</p>

<p>"If this be one of our chief duties&mdash;promoting the
happiness of our neighbours&mdash;most certainly there is
nothing which so entirely runs counter to it, and
makes it impossible, as an undisciplined temper. For
of all things that are to be met with here on earth,
there is nothing which can give such continual, such
cutting, such useless pain. The touchy and sensitive
temper, which takes offence at a word; the
irritable temper, which finds offence in everything
whether intended or not; the violent temper, which
breaks through all bounds of reason when once
roused; the jealous or sullen temper, which wears
a cloud on the face all day, and never utters a word
of complaint; the discontented temper, brooding over
its own wrongs; the severe temper, which always looks
at the worst side of whatever is done; the wilful
temper, which over-rides every scruple to gratify a
whim,&mdash;what an amount of pain have these caused in
the hearts of men, if we could but sum up their results!
How many a soul have they stirred to evil impulses;
how many a prayer have they stifled; how many an
emotion of true affection have they turned to bitterness!
How hard they sometimes make all duties!
How painful they make all daily life! How they kill
the sweetest and warmest of domestic charities! The
misery caused by other sins is often much deeper and
much keener, more disastrous, more terrible to the
sight; but the accumulated pain caused by ill-temper
must, I verily believe, if added together, outweigh all
other pains that men have to bear from one another."</p>

<p>APRIL 23</p>

<p>"It is exceedingly noteworthy that in the rule laid down
here by our Lord, the responsibility of seeking reconciliation
is laid primarily, not upon the man who has done wrong,
but upon the man who has received the wrong. It is the
injured man who is to take the initiative, to go after the
offender, to seek him out, and to exhaust all proper means
of bringing him to a right state of mind, and of getting him
reconciled to the man whom he has wronged. It is only
after all these proper means have been exhausted, after the
man who has been injured has done everything in his power&mdash;a
great deal more than the law prescribed&mdash;it is then
only that he is to regard the offender as 'a heathen man
and a publican.' Is not this the exact opposite to the
world's code of morality upon that subject? Is it not the
rule among men of the world&mdash;I do not use the word in a
bad sense&mdash;is it not the rule among Christian men of the
world, who live what we should call on the whole good
honest lives, to wait until the offender has come to them
with a confession and an apology? And if they then accept
the apology and forgive the offence, they probably think
they have done something very magnanimous; nor would
they consider they had done anything very much amiss if
they refused to accept the apology, especially if the offence
had been a gross one. If the offender did not apologise,
even an otherwise good Christian would probably think
that he might treat the matter with indifference, take no
notice of it, and say to himself, 'He has offended me, I
will take no notice, I will leave him to himself.' Would
not men of the world&mdash;Christian men&mdash;consider that they
had upon the whole discharged the Christian duty of forgiveness
if they treated the offender in that way? But
the law which our Lord laid down in His answer to Peter,
which governed His own conduct, the law which rules the
dealing of Almighty God with sinful man, is that the man
who has been injured, to whom the wrong has been done,
is to make the first move, is to take the first step, is to go
after the man who has done the wrong, and use his utmost
means of persuasion to convince him of his guilt, and to
bring him back from the error of his ways."</p>

by humility: when a man knows his own weaknesses,
why should he be angry with others for pointing them
out? No doubt it is not very amiable of them to do
so, but still, truth is on their side. Secondly, by
reflection: after all we are what we are, and if we
have been thinking too much of ourselves, it is only
an opinion to be modified; the incivility of our neighbours
leaves us what we were before. Above all, by
pardon: there is only one way of not hating those who
do us wrong, and that is by doing them good; anger
is best conquered by kindness. Such a victory over
feeling may not indeed affect those who have wronged
us, but it is a valuable piece of self-discipline. It is
vulgar to be angry on one's own account; we ought
only to be angry for great causes. Besides, the
poisoned dart can only be extracted from the wound
by the balm of a silent and thoughtful charity. Why
do we let human malignity embitter us? Why should
ingratitude, jealousy&mdash;perfidy even&mdash;enrage us?
There is no end to recriminations, complaints, or
reprisals. The simplest plan is to blot everything
out. Anger, rancour, bitterness, trouble the soul.
Every man is a dispenser of justice; but there is

But it is something far more than patience and good temper
towards weakness that is demanded here. It is that the
strong, in whatsoever sphere their strength may lie, should
try in silence and simplicity, escaping the observation of
men, to take upon their own shoulders the burdens which
the weak are bearing; to submit themselves to the difficulties
amidst which the weak are stumbling on; to be, for
their help's sake, as they are; to share the fear, the dimness,
the anxiety, the trouble and heart-sinking through
which they have to work their way; to forego and lay aside
the privilege of strength in order to understand the weak
and backward and bewildered, in order to be with them,
to enter into their thoughts, to wait on their advance; to
be content, if they can only serve, so to speak, as a favourable
circumstance for their growth towards that which God
intended them to be. It is the innermost reality of sympathy,
it is the very heart and life of courtesy, that is

to men, in relation to life, in relation to the known
to-day and the near to-morrow, and not to the unknown
eternity. We hear much of love to God; Christ spoke
much of love to man. We make a great deal of peace
with heaven; Christ made much of peace on earth.
Religion is not a strange or added thing, but the inspiration
of the secular life, the breathing of an eternal
spirit through this temporal world. The supreme

a further finish to the multitudinous words and acts

<p>MAY 12</p>

<p>"It is astonishing how large a part of Christ's precepts
is devoted solely to the inculcation of happiness.
How much of His life, too, was spent simply in making
people happy! There was no word more often on His
lips than 'blessed,' and it is recognised by Him as a
distinct end in life, <i>the</i> end for this life, to secure the
happiness of others. This simple grace, too, needs
little equipment. Christ had little. One need scarcely
even be happy one's self. Holiness, of course, is a
greater word, but we cannot produce that in others.
That is reserved for God Himself, but what is put in
our power is happiness, and for that each man is his
brother's keeper. Now society is an arrangement for
producing and sustaining human happiness, and temper
is an agent for thwarting and destroying it. Look at
the parable of the Prodigal Son for a moment, and see
how the elder brother's wretched pettiness, explosion
of temper, churlishness, spoiled the happiness of a
whole circle. First, it certainly spoiled his own.
How ashamed of himself he must have been when
the fit was over, one can well guess. Yet these things
are never so quickly over as they seem. Self-disgust
and humiliation may come at once, but a good deal
else within has to wait till the spirit is tuned again.
For instance, prayer must wait. A man cannot pray
till the sourness is out of his soul. He must first
forgive his brother who trespassed against him before
he can go to God to have his own trespasses forgiven."</p>

must find the better part of happiness in helping
another. She often thought it wisest not to raise too

impress on ordinary natures the immense possibilities
of making a small circle brighter and better. Few are

<p>MAY 15</p>

<p>"Character cannot be formed without action. Through it
strength comes. But every action must have its reaction
upon the nature of the one who puts it forth. If it does
not, it fails of that which is its highest result; for the finest
expression of a man's nature is not to be found in action,
but in that very intangible thing which we call his atmosphere.
There are a great many people who are alert, energetic, and
decisive, but who give forth very little of this rare effluence&mdash;this
quality which seems to issue out of the very recesses
of one's nature. It is, however, through this quality that
the most constant influence is exercised; that influence
which is not only put forth most steadily, but which penetrates
and affects others in the most searching way. The
air we breathe has much to do with health; in a relaxing
atmosphere it is difficult to work; in an atmosphere of
vitality it is easy to work. We never meet some people
without going away from them with our ideals a little
blurred, or our faith in them a little disturbed. We can
never part from others without a sense of increased hope.
There are those who invigorate us by simple contact;
something escapes from them of which they are not aware
and which we cannot analyse, which makes us believe more
deeply in ourselves and our kind.</p>

<p>"So far as charm is concerned, there is no quality which
contributes so much to it as the subtle thing we call
atmosphere. There are some people who do not need to
speak in order not only to awaken our respect, but to give
us a sense of something rare and fine. In such an influence,
all that is most individual and characteristic flows together,
and the woman reveals herself without being conscious that
she is making herself known. Such an atmosphere in a
home creates a sentiment and organises a life which would
not be possible if one should attempt to fashion these things
by intention. The finest things, like happiness, must be
sought by indirection and are the results of character, rather
than objects of immediate pursuit."</p>

<p>MAY 16</p>

<p>"Jesus afterwards focussed the new type of character
in a lovely illustration which is not always appreciated
at its full value, because we deny it perspective. Every
reader of the Gospels has marked the sympathy of Jesus
with children. How He watched their games! How
angry He was with His disciples for belittling them!
How He used to warn men, whatever they did, never
to hurt a little child! How grateful were children's
praises when all others had turned against Him! One
is apt to admire the beautiful sentiment, and to forget
that children were more to Jesus than helpless gentle
creatures to be loved and protected. They were His
chief parable of the Kingdom of Heaven. As a type
of character the Kingdom was like unto a little child,
and the greatest in the Kingdom would be the most
child-like. According to Jesus, a well-conditioned
child illustrates better than anything else on earth
the distinctive features of Christian character. Because
he does not assert nor aggrandise himself. Because
he has no memory for injuries, and no room in
his heart for a grudge. Because he has no previous
opinions, and is not ashamed to confess his ignorance.
Because he can imagine, and has the key of another
world, entering in through the ivory gate and living
amid the things unseen and eternal. The new society
of Jesus was a magnificent imagination, and he who
entered it must lay aside the world standards and ideals
of character, and become as a little child."</p>

The strength of the temptation, or the suddenness of

tendency to that particular sort of sin; our wishes to
be better, the excellence of our feelings, the excellence
of our desires; the peculiarity of our circumstances,
the special disadvantages which make us worse off

too often that wrong is not really wrong, and
that though the deed was sinful the doer of it was
not. I do not mean that these palliations are never
worth anything, nor do I mean that in every case the
same deed is the same sin. There are no doubt infinite
varieties of guilt in what appears outwardly the same
deed, and God will distinguish between them and will
judge justly. But the habit of mind which leads us to
palliate our sins and find good excuses for them, has
this dangerous tendency, that it blinds us to the evil
of evil. We slip into the delusion that we are better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>

You cannot <i>be</i> good and <i>do</i> wrong. You cannot <i>be</i>
righteous and <i>do</i> unrighteousness. Granted that you
may slip once into a sin which notwithstanding is not
really a part of your nature. Still, this cannot happen
several times over. Make no mistake. If you <i>do</i>
wrong the deed is a real part of your life, and cannot
be removed out of it by any fancy of yours that it is

So, again, we must remember that sins of the spirit

describing a calculated course. Jesus made a brave
stand for each man as the possessor of will-power,
and master of his life. He sadly admitted that a
human will might be weakened by evil habits of
thought, He declared gladly that the Divine Grace
reinforced the halting will: but, with every qualification,
decision still rested in the last issue with the
man. 'If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean,' as if
his cure hinged on the Divine Will. Of course, I am
willing, said Jesus, and referred the man back to his
inalienable human rights. Jesus never diverged into
metaphysics, even to reconcile the freedom of the
human will with the sovereignty of the Divine. His

should appeal from his tired to his refreshed self; and
men need to deal strictly with the body, and to bring
it into subjection, not only lest its appetites grow
riotous, but also lest it trouble, with moods and
miseries of its own, the exercise of judgment.</p>

the control that a strong and vigilant will can sometimes
gain over the encroachments of health that is not
sound, there must also be the insight and resourcefulness

<p>JUNE 29</p>

<p>"It is my way when I observe any instance of folly,
any queer or absurd illusion, straightway to look for
something of the same type in myself, feeling sure
that amid all differences there will be a certain correspondence;
just as there is more or less correspondence
in the natural history even of continents widely
apart, and of islands in opposite zones....</p>

<p>"Introspection which starts with the purpose of
finding out one's own absurdities is not likely to be
very mischievous, yet of course it is not free from
dangers any more than breathing is, or the other
functions that keep us alive or active. To judge
of others by oneself is in its most innocent meaning
the briefest expression for our only method of knowing
mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean
in many cases either the vulgar mistake which reduces
every man's value to the very low figure at which the
valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the amiable
illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous
construction of the lower. One cannot give a recipe
for wise judgment: it resembles appropriate muscular
action, which is attained by the myriad lessons in
nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can
give."</p>

<p>JUNE 30</p>

<p>"Our Lord not only <i>told</i> men that they were the children
of God, that they should strive after their Father's likeness,
and that they might approach nearer and nearer to being
perfect as He is perfect: but, what was more than this, in
every word He spake,&mdash;whether of teaching, or reproof,
or expostulation, or in His passing words to those who
received His mercies,&mdash;He <i>treated</i> them as God's children.
Man, as man, has in His eyes a right to respect. Anger
we find with our Lord often, as also surprise at slowness
of heart, indignation at hypocrisy, and at the Rabbinical
evasions of the Law; but never in our Lord's words or
looks do we find personal disdain. Towards no human
being does He show contempt. The scribe would have
trodden the rabble out of existence; but there is no such
thing as rabble in our Lord's eyes. The master, in the
parable, asks concerning the tree, which is unproductively
exhausting the soil, why cumbers it the ground; but it is
not to be rooted up, till all has been tried. There it
stands, and mere existence gives it claims, for all that
exists is the Father's."</p>

<p>"Tennyson was very grand on contemptuousness. It was,
he said, a sure sign of intellectual littleness. Simply to
despise, nearly always meant not to understand. Pride
and contempt were specially characteristic of barbarians.
Real civilisation taught human beings to understand each
other better, and must therefore lessen contempt. It is a
little or immature or uneducated mind which readily despises.
One who has travelled and knows the world in its
length and breadth, respects far more views and standpoints
other than his own."</p>

<p>JULY 1</p>

<p>"There are thousands and thousands of little untruths
that hum and buzz and sting in society, which
are too small to be brushed or driven away. They
are in the looks, they are in the inflections and tones
of the voice, they are in the actions, they are in reflections
rather than in direct images that are represented.
They are methods of producing impressions that are
false, though every means by which they are produced
is strictly true. There are little unfairnesses between
man and man, that are said to be minor matters and
that are small things; there are little unjust judgments
and detractions; there are petty violations of conscience;
there are ten thousand of these flags of
passions in men which are called foibles or weaknesses,
but which eat like moths. They take away
the temper, they take away magnanimity and generosity,
they take from the soul its enamel and its
polish. Men palliate and excuse them, but that has
nothing to do with their natural effect on us. They
waste and destroy us, and that, too, in the soul's
silent and hidden parts."</p>

their children for slight faults, which make
little impression on the character, and are of no real
consequence. Whereas lying, in my opinion, and
obstinacy, though in a less degree, are vices, the rise
and progress of which ought to be particularly watched
and counteracted; these grow with their growth, and
when once the tongue has got a <i>wrong set, it is impossible
to put it straight again</i>. Whence we see men,
otherwise of honourable natures, slaves to this vice.
If falsehood had, like truth, only one face, we should be

<p>"The cruellest lies are often told in silence. A man
may have sat in a room for hours and not opened his
teeth, and yet come out of that room a disloyal friend
or a vile calumniator. And how many loves have
perished because, from pride, or spite, or diffidence,
or that unmanly shame which withholds a man from
daring to betray emotion, a lover, at the critical point
of the relation, has but hung his head and held his
tongue? And, again, a lie may be told by a truth, or
a truth conveyed through a lie. Truth to facts is not
always truth to sentiment; and part of the truth, as
often happens in answer to a question, may be the
foulest calumny. A fact may be an exception; but
the feeling is the law, and it is that which you must
neither garble nor belie. The whole tenor of a conversation
is a part of the meaning of each separate
statement; the beginning and the end define and
travesty the intermediate conversation. You never
speak to God; you address a fellow-man, full of his
own tempers: and to tell truth, rightly understood, is
not to state the true facts, but to convey a true impression;
truth in spirit, not truth to letter, is the
true veracity."</p>

<p>"There is no better way, I believe, in which to test the
reality of our culture than by the self-discipline it teaches
us to use in talk; and it may be that the chief service we
can render, the chief outcome that God looks for from our
higher education, is that in our homes, in the society around
us, we should set a higher example of the right use of
speech; the right tone and temper and reticence in conversation;
the abhorrence of idle words. Neither let us
think that this ever will be easy to us. We must not be
affected or pedantic, we must not be always setting other
people right; but we must be careful; we must keep our
wishes and passions from colouring our view of things; we
must take great pains to enter into the minds and feelings
of others, to understand how things look to them, and we
must remember that, whatever pains we take in that regard,
the result is still sure to be imperfect; we must rule our
moods, our likes and dislikes, with a firm hand; we must
distrust our general impressions till we have frankly, faithfully
examined them; we must resist the desire to say
clever or surprising things; we must be resolute not to
overstate our case; we must let nothing pass our lips that
charity would check; we must be always ready to confess
our ignorance, and to be silent.&mdash;Yes, it is a hard and long
task; but it is for a high end, and in a noble service. It

<p>JULY 22</p>

<p>"Courtesy is really doing unto others as you would
be done unto, and the heart of it lies in a careful consideration
for the feelings of other people. It comes

which it wields so quietly, to see the issues upon which
it tells in the lives that are affected by it, one may
begin to feel that its place is really with the great
forces of character that ennoble and redeem the world;
that, simply and lightly as it moves, it rests on deep
self-discipline and deals with a real task; that it is far
more than a decoration or luxury of leisurely excellence.
But it is in contact with those who are growing perfect
in it, those who never fail in it, that one may more
nearly realise its greatness. In seeing how every part
of life is lit and hallowed by it; how common incidents,
daily duties, chance meetings, come to be avenues of
brightness, and even means of grace; how points of
light come quivering out upon the dull routine of
business, or the conventionality of pleasure; how God
is served through every hour of the day;&mdash;it is in
seeing this that one may come to think it far from
strange that for His beginning of miracles our Saviour
chose an act of courtesy."</p>

We are always influencing each other&mdash;a truth which
I have often impressed upon you, because I feel its
deep importance. We cannot help ourselves. And
this influence, which we thus unconsciously exercise
by our mere presence, by look, gesture, expression of
face, is probably all the more potent for being unconscious.
There are germs of moral health or disease
continually passing from us and infecting for good or
ill those about us. We read that when our Lord was
on earth virtue went out of Him sometimes, and
healed the bodies of those who came in contact
with it. His Divine humanity was always diffusing
a spiritual atmosphere of purity around Him, which
attracted, they knew not how, those who came within
the sphere of His influence. So it must be with us in
so far as our characters are pure and unselfish and
Christlike. Our very presence will influence for good
all who are near us, making them purer and nobler
and more unselfish, and shaming what is mean and
base out of them. If, on the other hand, our characters
are ignoble and impure, we shall exude, without
knowing or intending it, a poisonous influence
on all who come near us. Have we not sometimes
felt this mysterious influence&mdash;a presence attracting,
perhaps awing, us by some sort of spiritual magnetism;
or, on the other hand, repelling us as by the presage
of impending danger? Let us endeavour to keep
this inalienable responsibility of ours always in our
thoughts. And it will be a great help to test ourselves
now and then by the example of our Divine Master."</p>

people who are just making their associations and

induces us to draw towards those who do not know as

is a smaller tax upon our powers to be in their society.
But it is bad for us. I am sure that I have known
men, intellectually and morally very strong, the whole

suffered and been dwarfed, because they have only

not lived with men greater than themselves. Whatever
else they lose, they surely must lose some culture

enlargement of human responsibility, because it constitutes
us, in a measure, guardians each of the other's
soul. And yet, it is never the suppression of a weak
individuality by a strong one. That is not even true
discipleship, but spiritual tyranny. What the play of
two personalities brings about is a fuller, deeper self-realisation
on either side. The experience of comradeship,
with all the new knowledge and insight that it
brings into a life, can leave no ideal unchanged, but
the change is not of the nature of a substitution, but
of continuous growth. It is not mental or moral
bondage, but deliverance from both.</p>

<p>"And it is the deliverance from bondage to ourselves.
It is our refuge from pride. More than all else, comradeship
teaches us to walk humbly with God. For while
God's trivial gifts may allow us to grow vain and self-complacent,
His great gifts, if we once recognise them,
make us own our deep unworthiness, and bow our heads
in unspeakable gratitude. We may have rated our deserts
high, and taken flattery as our just due; we may
have competed for the world's prizes, and been filled
with gratified ambition at securing them. But however
high we rate ourselves, in the hour in which the soul is
conscious of its spiritual comrades, we know that God's
great infinite gift of human love is something we have
never earned, could never earn by merit or achievement,
by toil, or prayer, or fasting. It has come to us straight
out of the heart of the eternal Fatherhood; and all our

<p>"... For instance, it often happens that friends
need remonstrance and even reproof. When these
are administered in a kindly spirit they ought to be
taken in good part. But somehow or other there is
truth in what my friend Terence says in his Andria:
'Compliance gets us friends, plain speaking hate.'</p>

<p>"Plain speaking is a cause of trouble, if the result
of it is resentment, which is poison to friendship; but
compliance is really the cause of much more trouble,
because by indulging his faults it lets a friend plunge
into headlong ruin. But the man who is most to
blame is he who resents plain speaking and allows
flattery to egg him on to his ruin.... If we remonstrate,
it should be without bitterness; if we reprove,
there should be no word of insult.... But if a man's
ears are so closed to plain speaking that he cannot
bear to hear the truth from a friend, we may give him
up in despair. This remark of Cato's, as so many of
his did, shews great acuteness: 'There are people
who owe more to bitter enemies than to apparently
pleasant friends: the former often speak the truth, the
latter never.' Besides, it is a strange paradox that
the recipients of advice should feel no annoyance
where they ought to feel it, and yet feel so much
where they ought not. They are not at all vexed
at having committed a fault, but very angry at being
reproved for it."</p>

better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and

in all true friendship is the same. We pledge our
friend faithfulness, with all that faithfulness includes.
We know not what demands upon us this sacred
compact may make in years to come. Misfortune may
befall our friend, and he may require our aid in many
ways. Instead of being a help he may become a
burden. But friendship must not fail, whatever its

<p>"And though Aristotle does well to warn us that
absence dissolves friendship, it is happily none the
less true that friend may powerfully influence friend
though the two be by no means constant associates.
Even far removal in place, or in occupation, or in
fortunes, cannot arrest influence. For once any man
has true friends, he never again frames his decisions,
even those that are most secret, as if he were alone
in the world. He frames them habitually in the
imagined company of his friends. In their visionary
presence he thinks and acts; and by them, as visionary
tribunal, he feels himself, even in his unspoken intentions
and inmost feelings, to be judged. In this aspect
friendship may become a supreme force both to encourage
and restrain. For it is not simply what our
friends expect of us that is the vital matter here.
They are often more tolerant of our failings than is
perhaps good for us. It is what in our best moments
we believe that they expect of us. For it is then that
they become to us, not of their own choice but of ours,
a kind of second conscience, in whose presence our
weaknesses and backslidings become 'that worst kind
of sacrilege that tears down the invisible altar of
trust.'"</p>

delicate tenderness of friendship; then, when they lie

gathers to do them honour. Every one remembers a
personal kindness received, a favour shown, some help
given, and speaks of it in grateful words. Letters full
of appreciation, commendation, and gratitude are
written to sorrowing friends. Flowers are sent and
piled about the coffin, enough to have strewn every
hard path of the long years of struggle. How surprised

<p>"It was the old problem, of love that may not even
spend itself for those it loves. Some hold that the
purpose of such privation&mdash;as bitter to the spirit as the
loss of light, and warmth, and air to the body&mdash;is to
teach men to love God, and not their fellow-men.
Rather, it is to teach them to love human beings more,
with love not separate from the love of God, but near
to His own heart. Such love is never fruitless,
though it may seem to be. Our longing to serve
personally is often only longing for the personal
reward of service; and love that serves in finite
fashion often misses the mark. We hurt where we
desire to heal: we bind a greater burden on the life
whose load we only strive to lighten. God's cross is
always a crown: our crowns are often crosses. The
cup of water that we put to our friend's lips is from a
poisoned spring. Only the cup that we give God to
bear to him, is always pure and cool."</p>

<p>"When one comes to the loss of young children&mdash;a
sad perplexity&mdash;let it not be forgotten that they were
given. If in the hour of bitterest grief it were asked of
a bereaved mother whether she would prefer never to
have possessed in order that she might never have lost&mdash;her
heart would be very indignant. No little child
has ever come from God and stayed a brief while in
some human home&mdash;to return again to the Father&mdash;without
making glad that home and leaving behind
some trace of heaven. A family had counted themselves
poorer without those quaint sayings, those cunning
caresses, that soft touch, that sudden smile. This
short visit was not an incident: it was a benediction.
The child departs, the remembrances, the influence,
the associations remain. If one should allow us to
have Sarto's Annunciation for a month, we would thank
him: when he resumed it for his home he would not
take everything, for its loveliness of maid and angel
is now ours for ever. And if God recalls the child He
lent, then let us thank Him for the loan, and consider
that what made that child the messenger of God&mdash;its
purity, modesty, trustfulness, gladness&mdash;has passed

<p>SEPTEMBER 10</p>

<p>"Most persons have died before they expire&mdash;died to
all earthly longings, so that the last breath is only, as
it were, the locking of the door of the already deserted
mansion. The fact of the tranquillity with which the
great majority of dying persons await this locking of
those gates of life through which its airy angels have
been coming and going from the moment of the first
cry, is familiar to those who have been often called
upon to witness the last period of life. Almost always
there is a preparation made by Nature for unearthing
a soul, just as on the smaller scale there is for the
removal of a milk tooth. The roots which hold human
life to earth are absorbed before it is lifted from its
place. Some of the dying are weary, and want rest,
the idea of which is almost inseparable, in the universal
mind, from death. Some are in pain, and want to be
rid of it, even though the anodyne be dropped, as in
the legend, from the sword of the Death-Angel. And
some are strong in faith and hope, so that, as they
draw near the next world, they would fain hurry toward
it, as the caravan moves faster over the sands
when the foremost travellers send word along the file
that water is in sight. Though each little party that
follows in a foot-track of its own will have it that the
water to which others think they are hastening is a
mirage, not the less has it been true in all ages, and
for human beings of every creed which recognised a
future, that those who have fallen, worn out by their
march through the Desert, have dreamed at least of a
River of Life, and thought they heard its murmurs as
they lay dying."</p>

night of your ignorance, will only break and hurt yourselves
on broken laws.</p>

<p>"Before Christ came, the Jewish religion had forbidden
many evil things; it was a religion that a man could fulfil,
I had almost said, in idleness; all he had to do was to
pray and to sing psalms, and to refrain from things forbidden.
Do not deceive yourselves; when Christ came, all
was changed. The injunction was then laid upon us not
to refrain from doing, but to do. At the last day He is to
ask us not what sins we have avoided, but what righteousness
we have done, what we have done for others, how we
have helped good and hindered evil: what difference has
it made to this world and to our country and our family
and our friends, that we have lived. The man who has
been only pious and not useful will stand with a long face
on that great day, when Christ puts to him His questions.</p>

<p>"But this is not all that we must learn: we must beware
everywhere of the letter that kills, seek everywhere for the
spirit that makes glad and strong. For example, these
questions that we have just read are again only the letter.
We must study what they mean, not what they are. We
are told to visit them that are in prison. A good thing,
but it were better if we could save them going there. We
are told to visit the sick; it were better still, and we should
so better have fulfilled the law, if we could have saved
some of them from falling sick."</p>

<p>"We are often reminded that Christ left no code of commandments.
It is in Him&mdash;in His Person and His work&mdash;the
Law lies. He has given indeed for our instruction
some applications of the negative precepts of the Decalogue
to the New Order. He has added some illustrations of
positive duties, almsgiving, prayer, fasting. He has set up
an ideal and a motive for life; and, at the same time, He
has endowed His Church with spiritual power, and has
promised that the Paraclete, sent in His Name, shall guide
it into all the Truth.</p>

<p>(The fundamental principle of the Christian Social
Union is "to claim for the Christian Law the ultimate
authority to rule social practice.")</p>

<p>"The Christian Law, then, is the embodiment of the
Truth for action in forms answering to the conditions of
society from age to age. The embodiment takes place
slowly, and it can never be complete. It is impossible for
us to rest indolently in the conclusions of the past. In
each generation the obligation is laid on Christians to bring
new problems of conduct and duty into the Divine light,
and to find their solution under the teaching of the Spirit.
The unceasing effort to fulfil the obligation establishes the
highest prerogative of man, and manifests the life of the
Church. From this effort there can be no release; and
the effort itself becomes more difficult as human relations
grow fuller, wider, more complex."</p>

<p>"The sanction of this Law (the Christian Law) is not fear
of punishment, but that self-surrender to an ever-present
Lord, of those who are His slaves at once and His friends,
which is perfect freedom. This Law animates the heart
of him who receives it with the invigorating truth that
character is formed rather by what we do than by what we
refrain from doing. It requires that every personal gift
and possession should minister to the common welfare, not
in the way of ransom, or as a forced loan, but as an offering
of love. It reaches to the springs of action, and gives to
the most mechanical toil the dignity of a divine service.
It makes the strong arm co-operate in one work with the
warm heart and the creative brain. It constrains the poet
and the artist to concentrate their magnificent powers on
things lovely and of good report, to introduce us to characters
whom to know is a purifying discipline, and to fill the
souls of common men with visions of hidden beauty and
memories of heroic deeds. It enables us to lift up our
eyes to a pattern of human society which we have not yet
dared to contemplate, a pattern which answers to the constitution
of man as he was made in the Divine image to
gain the Divine likeness. It forbids us to seek repose till,
as far as lies in us, all labour is seen to be not a provision
for living, but a true human life; all education a preparation
for the vision of God here and hereafter; all political
enterprise a conscious hastening of the time when the
many nations shall walk in the light of the holy city, and
the kings of the earth bring their glory into it."</p>

perfect development of every man for the occupation

office in the 'Body of Christ'; and as a first step
towards this, we are all bound as Christians to bring
to our country the offering of our individual service
in return for the opportunities of culture and labour
which we receive from its organisation. We are all
as Christians trustees and stewards of everything
which we possess, of our time, our intellect, our influence,
no less than of our riches. We ourselves are
not our own: still less can we say of that which we
inherit or acquire, 'It is my own.' We all belong, in
the fulness of life 'in Christ,' to our fellow-citizens,
and our nation belongs to mankind. What we hold
for a time is to be administered for the relief of distresses,
and for the elevation of those among whom we
are placed. Personal and social egoism are equally
at variance with this conception of humanity. The
repression of individuality and the individual appropriation
of the fruits of special vigour and insight
equally tend to impoverish the race. Service always

as it was. He had no quarrel with existing institutions.
He did not overthrow the Church&mdash;He went
to Church. He said nothing against politics&mdash;He supported
the government of the country. He did not
denounce society&mdash;His first public action was to go
to a marriage. His great aim, in fact, outwardly, and
all along, was to be as normal, as little eccentric as
possible. The true fanatic always tries the opposite.
The spirit alone was singular in Jesus; a fanatic
always spoils his cause by extending it to the letter.
Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfil. A fanatic
comes not to fulfil, but to destroy. If we would
follow the eccentricity of our Master, let it not be

<p>SEPTEMBER 23</p>

<p>"If we want to get religion into life, or anything
whatever in us into life, we are bound to have no contentment,
no rest, no dreaming, no delays, till we get
thought into shape, feeling into labour, some conviction,
some belief, some idea, into form without us,
among the world of men. This is the main principle,
and it applies to every sphere of human effort. So
much for the habit whereby we gain power to bring
religion into daily life.</p>

<p>"Righteousness, shaped from within to without in
the world of men, is justice, and the doing of justice.
This is the first need of commonwealths, the first duty
of individuals, and the practical religion of both. A
still higher form into which we may put our religion in
life is in doing the things which belong to love; and
love is the higher form because it secures justice.
These are the things we should shape into life because
we love them. To be faithful always to that which
we believe to be true; to be faithful to our principles
and our conscience when trial comes, or when we
are tempted to sacrifice them for place or pelf; to be
faithful to our given word; to keep our promises
when we might win favour by eluding or breaking
them; to cling to intellectual as well as to moral truth;
to so live among men that they may know where we
are; to fly our flag in the storm as well as in the
calm. It is to pass by with contempt the dark cavern
where men worship Mammon; to fix our thought and
effort on the attainment of righteousness in public and
in private homes, to have the courage to attempt what
seems impossible through love of the ideals of truth
and beauty, and to prefer to die on the field of work
and self-devotion rather than to live in idleness and
luxury."</p>

when a man is very sad, for the loss of relations or

outward sign that can be displayed at will is liable to
abuse, and so men sometimes fasted when they were
not really sad, but when it was decorous to appear so.
Moreover a kind of merit came to be attached to fasting
as betokening sorrow for transgressions; and at
last it came to be regarded as a sort of self-punishment
which it was thought the Almighty would accept
in lieu of inflicting punishment Himself. Our Lord
does not decry stated fasts or any other Jewish practices,

<p>"For how, as a matter of fact, do we grow to
know God? Let me refer you to Professor Flint's
book on Theism for the best answer I know.
We begin to know God as we begin to know
our fellow-man&mdash;through His manifestations. We
may be tempted to think that we cannot know what
we cannot see, but in a perfectly true sense we
never see our fellow-man: we see his manifestations;
we see his outward appearance. We hear what he
says; we notice what he does, and we infer from all
this what his unseen character is like, what the man
is in himself; so similarly and as surely we learn to
know God. We see what He has done in nature and
in history; we see what He is doing to-day; we read
what He has conveyed to us for our instruction 'in
sundry times and in divers manners'; and so we
learn to listen for and to love 'the still small voice'
in which He speaks to our hearts. One knowledge is
as gradual and yet as sure and certain and logical as
the other."</p>

<p>"'We do not present our supplications before Thee
for our righteousness, but for Thy great mercies. O
Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and
do.'&mdash;Dan. ix. 18, 19.</p>

<p>"Every true prayer has its background and its
foreground. The foreground of prayer is the intense,
immediate desire for a certain blessing which seems
to be absolutely necessary for the soul to have; the
background of prayer is the quiet earnest desire that
the will of God, whatever it may be, should be done.
What a picture is the perfect prayer of Jesus in
Gethsemane! In front burns the strong desire to
escape death and to live; but, behind, there stands,
calm and strong, the craving of the whole life for the
doing of the will of God.... Leave out the foreground&mdash;let
there be no expression of the wish of him
who prays&mdash;and there is left a pure submission which
is almost fatalism. Leave out the background&mdash;let
there be no acceptance of the will of God&mdash;and the
prayer is only an expression of self-will, a petulant
claiming of the uncorrected choice of him who prays.
Only when the two, foreground and background, are
there together,&mdash;the special desire resting on the
universal submission, the universal submission opening
into the special desire,&mdash;only then is the picture
perfect and the prayer complete!"</p>

is, to take a mundane simile, like opening a sluice

that a man may go on uttering false assertions about
his own acts till he at last believes in them: is it not
possible that sometimes in the very first utterance

of a traditional self which is clung to against
all evidence? There is no knowing all the disguises

a force of nature: you might say the trees are selfish.

Christ does not cry down <i>self</i>, but He puts it out of a

for, something which shall take full and rightful possession
of his soul. The Apostles, without ever having
any consciousness of sacrificing self, were brought into

themselves in devotion to a Master and a cause, and

<p>OCTOBER 26</p>

<p>"A fourth maxim is 'never if possible to lose a
battle.' And none can be sounder. For it is always
to be remembered that a single lapse involves here
something worse than a simple failure. The alternative
is not between good habit or no habit, but between
good habit and bad. For, as Professor Bain points
out, the characteristic difficulty here lies in the fact
that in the moral life rival tendencies are in constant
competition for mastery over us. The loss
of a battle here is therefore worse than a defeat. It
strengthens the enemy, whether this enemy be some
powerful passion, or nothing more than the allurements
of an easy life. It has worse effects still. For
if by persistence in well-doing we all of us create a
moral tradition for our individual selves, so do we by
every failure hang in the memory a humiliating and
paralysing record of defeat."</p>

<p>OCTOBER 31</p>

<p>"Plutarch records that when Simonides offered to
teach Themistocles the art of memory the latter said:
'Teach me rather the art of forgetting.' How much
the world needs to learn that art. Paul spoke of forgetting
the things that are behind. We should forget
our mistakes and failures, so far as these cause discouragement.
We should forget our successes if they
cause pride or preoccupy the mind. We should forget
the slights that have been put upon us or the insults
that have been given us. To remember these is to be
weak and miserable, if not worse. He who says he
can forgive but he cannot forget is deceived by the
sound of words. Forgiveness that is genuine involves
forgetfulness of the injury. True forgiveness means a
putting away of the wrong behind the back and remembering
it no more. That is what God does when
He forgives, and that is what we all must do if we
truly forgive."</p>

<p>"... It is wise to forget past errors. There is a kind
of temperament which, when indulged, greatly hinders
growth in real godliness. It is that rueful, repentant,
self-accusing temper, which is always looking back,
and microscopically observing how that which is done
might have been better done. Something of this we
ought to have. A Christian ought to feel always that
he has partially failed, but that ought not to be the
only feeling. Faith ought ever to be a sanguine,
cheerful thing; and perhaps in practical life we could
not give a better account of faith than by saying, that
it is, amidst much failure, having the heart to <i>try
again</i>. Our best deeds are marked by imperfection;
but if they really were our best, 'forget the things
that are behind'&mdash;we shall do better next time."</p>

this the Apostles therefore are always diverted, and
they are to be watchful to prevent others from sinking
into dejection and folding their hands in despair. A

he is so far encouraged as to be able to exert himself
his despondency soon disappears."</p>

has brought you? Great trials come at lengthened
intervals, and we rise to breast them; but it is the
petty friction of our everyday life with one another,
the jar of business or of work, the discord of the

<p>"The true felicity of life is to be free from perturbations;
to understand our duties towards God and
man; to enjoy the present without any serious
dependence upon the future. Not to amuse ourselves
with either hopes or fears, but to rest satisfied with
what we have. The great blessings of mankind are
within our reach; but we shut our eyes, and, like
people in the dark, we fall foul upon the very thing
we search for, without finding it. Tranquillity is the
state of human perfection, it raises us as high as we
can go, and makes every man his own supporter;
whereas he that is borne up by anything else may fall.
He that judges right and perseveres in it, enjoys a
perpetual calm; he takes a true prospect of things;
he observes an order, measure, a decorum in all his
actions; he has a benevolence in his nature; and
squares his life according to reason, and draws to himself
love and admiration. Without a certain and unchangeable
judgment, all the rest is but fluctuation.
Liberty and serenity of mind must necessarily ensue
upon the mastering of those things which either allure
or affright us, when, instead of those flashy pleasures
we shall find ourselves possessed of joys transporting
and everlasting."</p>

Under-bred and ill-educated women are, as a general
rule, much less good-looking than well-bred and highly-educated
ones, especially in middle life; not because
good features and pretty complexions belong to one
class more than to another, but because nicer personal
habits and stricter discipline of the mind do.... And
if, into the bargain, a woman has nothing to talk about
but her own and her neighbour's everyday affairs, and
nothing to think about to keep her from continually
talking, life, my dear child, is so full of little rubs,
that constant chatter of this kind must almost certainly

<p>NOVEMBER 25</p>

<p>"There is a sect, unfortunately known to most in this
land, under the denomination of Grumblers, whose fundamental
maxim is&mdash;whatever is, is wrong. Wherever they
are found, and they are found almost everywhere, they
operate as a social poison; and though they contrive to
embitter the enjoyments of everybody about them, they
perpetually assume that themselves are the only aggrieved
persons, and with such art as to be believed, till thoroughly
known. They have often some excellent qualities, and the
appearance of many amiable ones; but rank selfishness is
their chief characteristic, accompanied by inordinate pride
and vanity. They have a habit of laying the consequences
of their own sins, whether of omission or of commission,
upon others; and, covered with faults, they flatter themselves
they 'walk blameless.' Where their selfishness, pride,
or vanity are interested, they exhibit signs of boundless
zeal, attention, and affection, to which those who are not
aware of their motives, are the dupes; but the very moment
their predominant feelings are offended, they change from
April to December. They have smiles and tears at command
for their holiday humour; but in 'the winter of
their discontent,' there is no safety from the bitterest
blasts. Their grievances are seldom real, or if real, are
grossly exaggerated, and are generally attributed to themselves;
for, absorbed in their own feelings, they are
wonderful losers of opportunities. In conclusion, I think
it would be for their advantage, as it certainly would be for
that of the rest of the world, if they were made subject to
some severe discipline; and I would suggest for the first,
second, and third offence, bread and water and the treadmill,
for one, two, and three months respectively; for the
fourth offence, transportation for seven years to Boothia
Felix, or some such climate; and any subsequent delinquency
I would make capital, and cause the criminal to
be shut up with some offender in equal degree, there to
grumble each other to death."</p>

<p>"Gravity ... I mean simply that grave and serious
way of looking at life which, while it never repels the
true light-heartedness of pure and trustful hearts,
welcomes into a manifest sympathy the souls of men
who are oppressed and burdened, anxious and full of
questions which for the time at least have banished all
laughter from their faces.... Gravity has a delicate
power of discrimination. It attracts all that it can help,
and it repels all that could harm it or be harmed by
it. It admits the earnest and simple with a cordial
welcome. It shuts out the impertinent and insincere
inexorably.</p>

<p>"The gravity of which I speak is not inconsistent
with the keenest perception of the ludicrous side of
things. It is more than consistent with&mdash;it is even

cannot encourage it too much. You cannot grow too
familiar with the books of all ages which have in them
the truest humour, for the truest humour is the bloom

Words are wonderful enough, but music is more

do, it speaks straight to our hearts and spirits, to the
very core and root of our souls. Music soothes us,
stirs us up; it puts noble feelings into us; it melts us
to tears, we know not how; it is a language by itself,
just as perfect, in its way, as speech, as words; just
as divine, just as blessed. Music has been called the
speech of angels; I will go farther, and call it the
speech of God Himself.</p>

<p>"The old Greeks, the wisest of all the heathen,
made a point of teaching their children music, because,
they said, it taught them not to be self-willed and
fanciful, but to see the beauty of order, the usefulness

<p>"Beauty is far too much neglected. It never belongs
to criticism; it ought by right to be always bound
up with creation. What it is, is hard to define; but,
whenever anything in nature or in the thoughts and
doings of man awakens a noble desire of seeing more
of it; kindles pure love of it; seems to open out before
us an infinite of it which allures us into an endless
pursuit; stimulates reverence, and makes the heart
leap with joy&mdash;there is beauty, and with it always is
imagination, the shaping power.</p>

<p>"The capacity for seeing beauty with the heart is
one of the first necessities for such a life in a living
world as I now urge upon you. When you see it, you
always see more and more of it. And the more you
see it, the more love and reverence you will feel in
your heart; and the less you will care to criticise, and
the more you will care to create. The world needs it
now, and the glory of it, more almost than anything
else, for nearly all the world has lost the power of
seeing it. The monied men want it; the scientific
men want it; the artists themselves have of late
betrayed it; the business men want it. The middle-class
and the aristocracy are almost destitute of it;
the working men abide in conditions in which its outward
forms are absent. To give them the power to
see all that is lovely in nature, in human thought, in
art, and in the noble acts of men&mdash;that is a great part

<p>"The cheerfulness of heart which springs up in us
from the survey of Nature's works, is an admirable
preparation for gratitude. The mind has gone a great
way towards praise and thanksgiving that is filled with
such a secret gladness: a grateful reflection on the
Supreme Cause who produces it, sanctifies the soul,
and gives it its proper value. Such an habitual disposition
of mind consecrates every field and wood,
turns an ordinary walk into a morning or evening
sacrifice, and will improve those transient gleams of
joy, which naturally brighten up and refresh the soul
on such occasions, into an inviolable and perpetual
state of bliss and happiness."</p>

<p>DECEMBER 4</p>

<p>"There are only two rules for a successful holiday;
the first is to earn it, the second is to have just enough
holiday to make the prospect of work pleasant.
Periods of rest we all need, but labour and not rest
is the synonym of life. From these periods of rest
we should return with a new appetite for the duties
of common life. If we return dissatisfied, enervated,
without heart for work, we may be sure our holiday
has been a failure. If we return with the feeling that
it is good to plunge into the mid-stream of life again,
we may know by this sign that we are morally braced
and strengthened by our exodus. The wise man will
never allow his holiday to be a time of mere idleness.
He will turn again to the books that interest him, he
will touch the fringe of some science for which his
holiday gives him opportunity, or he will plunge into
physical recreation, and shake off the evil humours of
the body in active exercise. The failure of holidays
lies very much in the fact that nothing of this sort is
attempted. The holiday is simply a series of aimless
days, and the natural result is <i>ennui</i>. The supreme
purpose of a holiday should be to regain possession of
ourselves. He who does this comes back from his
holiday as from a sanctuary."</p>

call into play, to develop, to direct, to strengthen powers
of sense and intellect and spirit, not of one but of all:
to give alertness and accuracy to observation: to
supply fulness and precision to language: to arouse
intelligent sympathy with every form of study and

open the eyes of the heart to the eternal of which the
temporal is the transitory sign.</p>

<p>"Remember that the aim of your discipline should be to
produce a <i>self-governing</i> being, not to produce a being to be
<i>governed by others</i>. Were your children fated to pass their
lives as slaves, you could not too much accustom them to
slavery during their childhood; but as they are by-and-by
to be free men, with no one to control their daily conduct,
you cannot too much accustom them to self-control while
they are still under your eye. This is it which makes the
system of discipline by natural consequences so especially
appropriate to the social state which we in England have
now reached. In feudal times, when one of the chief evils
the citizen had to fear was the anger of his superiors, it was
well that during childhood parental vengeance should be
a chief means of government. But now that the citizen
has little to fear from any one&mdash;now that the good or evil
which he experiences is mainly that which in the order of
things results from his own conduct, he should from his
first years begin to learn, experimentally, the good or evil
consequences which naturally follow this or that conduct.
Aim, therefore, to diminish the parental government, as
fast as you can substitute for it in your child's mind that
self-government arising from a foresight of results....</p>

<p>"All transitions are dangerous; and the most dangerous
is the transition from the restraint of the family circle to
the non-restraint of the world. Hence the importance of
pursuing the policy we advocate, which, by cultivating a
boy's faculty of self-restraint, by continually increasing the
degree in which he is left to his self-restraint, and by so
bringing him, step by step, to a state of unaided self-restraint,
obliterates the ordinary sudden and hazardous
change from externally-governed youth to internally-governed
maturity. Let the history of your domestic rule
typify, in little, the history of our political rule. At the
outset, autocratic control, where control is really needful;
by-and-by an incipient constitutionalism, in which the
liberty of the subject gains some express recognition;
successive extensions of this liberty of the subject, gradually
ending in parental abdication."</p>

<p>DECEMBER 12</p>

<p>"Self-government with tenderness,&mdash;here you have the
condition of all authority over children. The child must
discover in us no passion, no weakness of which he can
make use; he must feel himself powerless to deceive or to
trouble us; then he will recognise in us his natural
superiors, and he will attach a special value to our kindness,
because he will respect it. The child who can rouse
in us anger, or impatience, or excitement, feels himself
stronger than we, and a child only respects strength. The
mother should consider herself as her child's sun, a changeless
and ever radiant world, whither the small restless
creature, quick at tears and laughter, light, fickle, passionate,
full of storms, may come for fresh stores of light, warmth
and electricity, of calm and of courage. The mother
represents goodness, providence, law; that is to say, the
divinity under that form of it which is accessible to childhood.
If she is herself passionate, she will inculcate on
her child a capricious and despotic God, or even several
discordant gods. The religion of a child depends on what
its mother and its father are, and not on what they say.
The inner and unconscious ideal which guides their life is
precisely what touches the child; their words, their remonstrances,
their punishments, their bursts of feeling, even, are
for him merely thunder and comedy; what they worship&mdash;this
it is which his instinct divines and reflects.</p>

<p>"The child sees what we are, behind what we wish to be.
Hence his reputation as a physiognomist. He extends his
power as far as he can with each of us; he is the most
subtle of diplomatists. Unconsciously he passes under the
influence of each person about him, and reflects it while
transforming it after his own nature. He is a magnifying
mirror. This is why the first principle of education is: train
yourself; and the first rule to follow if you wish to possess
yourself of a child's will is: master your own."</p>

<p>DECEMBER 14</p>

<p>"Punishments, then, must in the first place be proportionate
to the offence, lest, by an undiscriminating severity
or an undiscriminating leniency, distinctions of moral
desert be blurred or effaced.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, they must be analogous to the offence. The
greedy must be starved, the insolent humbled, the idle
compelled to work. Otherwise the imposition will not
effectually go home to the offender.</p>

<p>"<i>Thirdly</i>, punishments ought to be exemplary. Since
they needs must come, it is not enough that they should
simply open the eyes of the culprit, by giving him his
deserts. They must be utilised as object-lessons for the
behoof of that large class, the culprits in potentiality.</p>

<p>"<i>Fourthly</i>, they ought to be economical. 'It is good
that they should suffer,' we sometimes say; and so it is, so
long as suffering, in itself always an evil, do not exceed the
quantum that is lamentably needful, needful, that is, to
vindicate authority, to stigmatise the offence, and to impress
the offender.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifthly</i>, punishments ought to be reformatory. Not
only must they never, by vindictiveness in him who gives,
and degradation in him who receives, impair the instincts
and resolves for a better life; they must be devised in the
belief, or at least in the hope, that these instincts and
resolves exist, though they may be inhibited by the evil
proclivities which punishment is meant to crush. The
killing of what is bad must always look to the liberation of
what is good.</p>

<p>"<i>Finally</i>, punishments ought to insist upon, and to
define indemnity, so that the wrong-doer, in things small or
great, may be forced to repair, so far as this is possible, the
irreparable mischief which offence implies."</p>

suppress all wants which do not tend through their satisfaction
to create a nobler type of manhood, and individually
we shall recognise no wants which do not express what is
required for the due cultivation of our own powers and the
fulfilment of that which we owe to others. We shall guard
ourselves against the temptations of artificial wants which
the ingenuity of producers offers in seductive forms. We
shall refuse to admit that the caprice of fashion represents
any valuable element in our constitution, or calls into play
any faculties which would otherwise be unused, or encourages

<p>DECEMBER 22</p>

<p>"The truest hospitality is shown not in the effort to
entertain, but in the depth of welcome. What a guest
loves to come for, and come again, is not the meal,
but those who sit at the meal. If we remembered
this, more homes would be habitually thrown open to
win the benedictions upon hospitality. It is our ceremony,
not our poverty, it is self-consciousness oftener
than inability to be agreeable that makes us willing
to live cloistered. Seldom is it that pleasantest homes
to visit are the richest. The real compliment is <i>not</i>
to apologise for the simple fare. That means trust,
and trust is better than fried oysters."</p>

<p>"I pray you, O excellent wife, not to cumber yourself

ready at too great a cost. These things, if they are
curious in, they can get for a dollar at any village. But
let this stranger, if he will, in your looks, in your accent
and behaviour, read in your heart and earnestness,
your thought and will, which he cannot buy at any
price in any village or city, and which he may well
travel fifty miles and dine sparely and sleep hard in
order to behold. Certainly, let the board be spread
and let the bed be dressed for the traveller; but let
not the emphasis of hospitality lie in these things.

<p>A CHRISTMAS CAROL</p>

<p>
"It chanced upon the merry, merry Christmas Eve,<br />
I went sighing past the church across the moorland dreary&mdash;<br />
'Oh! never sin and want and woe this earth will leave,<br />
And the bells but mock the wailing rounds, they sing so cheery.<br />
How long, O Lord! how long before Thou come again!<br />
Still in cellar, and in garret, and on moorland dreary<br />
The orphans moan, and widows weep, and poor men toil in vain,<br />
Till earth is sick of hope deferred, though Christmas bells be cheery.'<br />
<br />
"Then arose a joyous clamour from the wild-fowl on the mere,<br />
Beneath the stars, across the snow, like clear bells ringing,<br />
And a voice within cried,&mdash;'Listen! Christmas carols even here!<br />
Tho' thou be dumb, yet o'er their work the stars and snows are singing.<br />
Blind! I live, I love, I reign; and all the nations through,<br />
With the thunder of my judgments even now are ringing;<br />
Do thou fulfil thy work but as yon wild-fowl do,<br />
Thou wilt heed no less the wailing, yet hear through it angels singing.'"<br />

in visible, actual union, in a life which is both human

meaning of the Day, and dare to think of your
Humanity as something so sublimely precious that it
is worthy of being made an offering to God. Count
it a privilege to make that offering as complete as

<p>DECEMBER 26</p>

<p>"But Christmas is not only the mile-mark of another
year, moving us to thoughts of self-examination: it is
a season, from all its associations, whether domestic
or religious, suggesting thoughts of joy. A man dissatisfied
with his endeavours is a man tempted to
sadness. And in the midst of the winter, when his
life runs lowest and he is reminded of the empty
chairs of his beloved, it is well he should be condemned
to this fashion of the smiling face. Noble
disappointment, noble self-denial, are not to be admired,
not even to be pardoned, if they bring bitterness.
It is one thing to enter the kingdom of heaven
maimed; another to maim yourself and stay without.
And the kingdom of heaven is of the childlike, of those
who are easy to please, who love and who give
pleasure."</p>

<p>DECEMBER 27</p>

<p>"To grow old is more difficult than to die, because
to renounce a good once and for all, costs less than to
renew the sacrifice day by day and in detail. To bear
with one's own decay, to accept one's own lessening
capacity, is a harder and rarer virtue than to face
death. There is a halo round tragic and premature
death; there is but a long sadness in declining
strength. But look closer: so studied, a resigned
and religious old age will often move us more than
the heroic ardour of young years. The maturity of
the soul is worth more than the first brilliance of
its faculties, or the plenitude of its strength, and the
eternal in us can but profit from all the ravages made
by time. There is comfort in this thought."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
